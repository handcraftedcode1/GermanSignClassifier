## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

Overview
---
In this project, I used my knowledge of deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. 

I trained and validated a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). 

After the model is trained, I tested model on images of random German traffic signs that I found on the web.
